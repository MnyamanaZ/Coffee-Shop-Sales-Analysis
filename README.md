# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis
This project involves analyzing revenue across store locations, product detail, type, category, time of the day trends and monthly pattern. It includes actionable insights on how to improve sales on under-performing stores and recommendations to sustain growth in well performing ones. I used real-world data and tools to uncover business insights and present data-driven recommendations.
The work includes raw data cleaning, SQL-based querying, visualizations using Excel and Canva, and structured planning via Miro.

This repository is a complete case study submission for my data analytics learning journey as an Aspiring Data Analyst, my aim is to showcase my ability to work through data workflow, from raw files to storytelling and presentation.

**Project Objectives:**
- Which products generate the most revenue 
-  What time of day the store performs best 
- Sales trends across products and time intervals 
- Recommendations for improving sales performance 

**Tools Used:**
- Excel – for raw data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualizations
- Snowflake SQL – for querying and analysis
- Miro – for outlining the project planning
- Canva – for building a business-style presentation
- GitHub – for structuring, storing, and documenting the entire project

**Recommendation**

**Hell’s Kitchen**: has high revenue, we should try and adopt its strategy and make sure that our customer service remains excellent also monitor customer feedback to keep the store’s revenue growing.

**Morning**: Is showing to be the most profitable time of the day across our stores, we could look at increasing our personnels and stock accordingly.

**Barista Espresso**: Is our top selling product, we must make sure that we have enough stock and ensure marketing support so that its sales continue to increase.
**Astoria**: Pride itself by brewed chai tea and dark chocolate, we could explore customer preference and see if we can make promotions on other products to increase their sales.
**Seasonality**: Seasons like summer affect our sales as we have seen on our graph that Jan and February sales are very low, we could build marketing strategies to avoid these dips in our sales.
