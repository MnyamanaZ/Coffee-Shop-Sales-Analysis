# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis
This project involves analyzing revenue across store locations, product detail, type, category, time of the day trends and monthly pattern. It includes actionable insights on how to improve sales on under-performing stores and recommendations to sustain growth in well performing ones. I used real-world data and tools to uncover business insights and present data-driven recommendations.
The work includes raw data cleaning, SQL-based querying, visualizations using Excel and Canva, and structured planning via Miro.

This repository is a complete case study submission for my data analytics learning journey as an Aspiring Data Analyst, my aim is to showcase my ability to work through data workflow, from raw files to storytelling and presentation.

Project Objectives:
- Which products generate the most revenue 
-  What time of day the store performs best 
- Sales trends across products and time intervals 
- Recommendations for improving sales performance 

Tools Used:
- Excel – for raw data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualizations
- Snowflake SQL – for querying and analysis
- Miro – for outlining the project methodology
- Canva – for building a business-style presentation
- GitHub – for structuring, storing, and documenting the entire project

Project Structure

My work is saved in folders,below is a breakdown for each folder under the Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis Repository:

DATA :Raw and Cleaned data

SQL CODE :Snowflake scrip

DOCUMENTS:Case study, Miro Plan and Methodology

PIVOT TABLES: Pivot table analysis in excel

PRESENTATION: Is in three formats power point, png slides and pdf                                                                                                                                        

Key Insights & Learnings:

- Some stores had significantly higher morning revenue — potential for breakfast promotions
- Certain products performed well only in specific locations for example Barista expresso performed well in Astoria — a chance for localized marketing
- The sales drop during mid-day hours revealed gaps in lunch offerings
- SQL filtering helped isolate high-value orders and drive recommendations
